# Summer Project on Cognition

The project done in summer 2017 under Prof. Nisheet Srivastava

## Steps for setting up a web server to handle queries

1.  We can very easily set up a python web based server that can be deployed locally and remotely using either ``` python 2.7 ``` or ``` python 3.1 ```
2. There are 2 options ``` flask ``` and ``` django ```
3. Once you install it, there would be a tutorial available on the web ``` attach link ``` which sets it up for you within seconds
4. Once that is done, add your original html file as index.html
5. Set up a ``` route ``` on your web server that accepts ``` POST ``` queries and calls a function
6. Write a function that will open the file where you are saving JSON objects one after another and save it in the said file
7. To handle all the JSON objects in python use the ``` json ``` package
8. Refer here for ``` ajax ``` queries to send the ``` POST ``` requests for your said talk.
